- On August 18, 2015, 2:11 PM (in the Philippine Time), I've seen the scammer post [Looking to hire Virtual Assistants]{:target="_blank"} and contacted him via his email.
- August 29, 11:57 PM, the scammer replied to my email asking for my Skype account.
- Aug. 30, 12:00 AM, the evil invited me add on Skype, and on 12:01 AM, I shared my contact details.
- And on Aug. 30, 12 to 4 AM, the scammer tell me what to do, to collect a PayPay payment from and send it to some people telling that we're doing an SEO business and I tried it to see how it works.
- Aug. 30, 02:59:42 GMT+08:00, I receive $300 from patelzmartinc@yahoo.com (Transaction ID # 55098245D3956733W) with a note: "Link Acquisition for Buzzfeed for kohlscouponsonline.com".
- Aug. 30, 3:01 AM, the scammer said, send the money to these people in different purposes of payments:
  - $30.00 USD for lancelottucker251@gmail.com [Lancelot Tucker \| LinkedIn] (# 7WW038243A039061C) as personal payment. *(On 3.09 AM, I'd asked him if there's illegal activities on our transactions but he said we deal completely in links and website development.)*
  - $210.00 USD to ceo.techdatacorporation@gmail.com Tech Data Corporation **(Customer Service Phone: +91 2703431)** with a subject of "Delivered Dijital Journal link" (# 43U43571AU324923M) as good or service.
  - $20.00 USD to vanvuongnguyenhuyen@gmail.com Huyen Nguyen Thu (# 7L610255DC481811A) as personal payment.
- On 3:17 AM, after I send the $210 to ceo.techdatacorporation@gmail.com **(Customer Service Phone: +91 2703431)**, I reviewed the [User Agreement for PayPal Services]{:target="_blank"} because I'm a rule abiding. And when I see the section *10. Restricted Activities. f. Send unsolicited email to a User or use the PayPal Services to collect payments for sending, or assisting in sending, unsolicited email to third parties;* I realize that I think it's against the ToS, and after that, I just finished THAT SINGLE JOB because I'm a good freelancer and not willing to accept such kind of gig anymore.
- Aug. 30, 11:26 AM in the morning, I ask him if there's referring the specific PayPal rule but he denied that there's no illegal activity. I have a lot of stress doing that single gig but I still finish to make my client satisfy as what I'm always doing..
