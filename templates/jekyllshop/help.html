		<h3 id="installation"><strong>A) Jekyllshop Installation</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>This Jekyll theme is an e-commerce script itself, to generate an awesome static online store with Jekyll. To install it, get the "jekyllshop" folder from the extracted/unzipped "jekyllshop-x.x.x" folder and place it as the theme or as the current directory of your Jekyll site. You can then rename it according to what you want.</p>

		<p>The top-level content structure of the unzipped "jekyllshop-x.x.x" folder looks like this:</p>

		<pre>	.
	├── assets/	&lt;─ Just the assets for the help file.
	├── jekyllshop/	&lt;─ THIS IS THE THEME AND IS WHAT YOU NEED TO GET!
	├── help.html	&lt;─ A help file or this documentation.</pre>

		<h3>Site Settings</h3>

		<p>And go to the "_config.yml" file of the Jekyllshop theme and set their settings, specially the <strong>baseurl</strong> and the <strong>url</strong> settings.</p>

		<pre>	baseurl: "/yourbaseurl"			# the subpath of your site, e.g. /jekyllshop
	url: "http://www.yourdomain.com"	# the base hostname & protocol for your site</pre>

		<p>You can find out more info about customizing a Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation on their website: <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyllrb.com</a><br>
		<u>If you did not know Jekyll</u>, then you probably need to read their documentation first and learn how they works!</p>

	<hr>

	<h3 id="importantFolders"><strong>B) Important Folders</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

	<p>Here are the most important folders inside of the Jekyllshop theme's directory that you need to understand:</p>

	<pre>	.
	├── _data/	&lt;─ Visit http://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/ for the complete info.
	├── _posts/	&lt;─ Visit http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/ for the complete info.
	├── categories/	&lt;─ This is the folder where the category files are located.
	├── products/	&lt;─ This is the folder where the product files are located.</pre>

	<p>Those folders' usages will be documented in the following sections of this documentation!</p>

	<hr>

	<h3 id="creatingCategories"><strong>C) Creating Categories</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

	<p>You need to create to a category before you can use it on your product. To create a product category, create a Markdown file, for example, such as "<b>sample-category</b>.md" under the "categories/" folder, in this Markdown format:</p>

	<pre>	---
	layout: category	# Do not change this
	title: Sample Category	# Your awesome category name
	---

	Write an awesome description for your new category here.</pre>

	<p>That category will now be accessible, for example, at: <em>http://www.yourdomain.com/yourbaseurl/categories/<b>sample-category</b>/</em></p>

	<p>The last directory name of its web address will be based on the category filename which in this example is <b>"sample-category"</b> without the ".md" file extension, and you can create as many categories as you want in the "categories/" folder.</p>

	<b>Here are some sample categories:</b>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://5ervant.github.io/templates/jekyllshop/demo/categories/cameras/">https://5ervant.github.io/templates/jekyllshop/demo/categories/cameras/</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://5ervant.github.io/templates/jekyllshop/demo/categories/sample-category-1/">https://5ervant.github.io/templates/jekyllshop/demo/categories/sample-category-1/</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://5ervant.github.io/templates/jekyllshop/demo/categories/sample-category-2/">https://5ervant.github.io/templates/jekyllshop/demo/categories/sample-category-2/</a></li>
	</ul>

	<hr>

	<h3 id="creatingProducts"><strong>D) Creating Products</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

	<p>To create a product item, create a Markdown file with such basename "<b>sample-product</b>.md", inside of the "products/" folder, in these Markdown and YAML formats:</p>

	<pre>	---
	title:      "Sample Product"
	categories: sample-category				# The previously one that we created
	tags:       sample-tag-1 sample-tag-2
	price:      0.02
	sale:       0.01					# Optional
	stock:      50						# Optional
	date:       2015-12-30					# Optional
	meta:       "Just a sample meta for this product."	# Optional
	author:     YourUsername				# Optional
	---

	Write an awesome Markdown text for your new product here.</pre>

	<p>That product will now be accessible, e.g. at: <em>http://www.yourdomain.com/yourbaseurl/products/<b>sample-product</b>/</em><br>
		Its web address' last directory name will be based on the product filename <b>"sample-product"</b> without the ".md" extension.</p>

	<p>You can use more than one category for your product as long as you created them! Separate them with a space " ", just like <var>tags</var>:</p>

	<pre>	categories: sample-category another-sample-category</pre>

	<b>Here are some sample products without images:</b>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://5ervant.github.io/templates/jekyllshop/demo/products/sample-product-1/">https://5ervant.github.io/templates/jekyllshop/demo/products/sample-product-1/</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://5ervant.github.io/templates/jekyllshop/demo/products/sample-product-2/">https://5ervant.github.io/templates/jekyllshop/demo/products/sample-product-2/</a></li>
	</ul>

	<p><u>You do not need to create a tag file.</u> You can use as many tags as you want, separated by a space " ".<br>
	A tag name must only have lowercase alphanumeric and a dash, such as "xyz-123".</p>

	<b>Here are some sample specified tags' sections:</b>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://5ervant.github.io/templates/jekyllshop/demo/tags/#tag-1">https://5ervant.github.io/templates/jekyllshop/demo/tags/#tag-1</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://5ervant.github.io/templates/jekyllshop/demo/tags/#nikon">https://5ervant.github.io/templates/jekyllshop/demo/tags/#nikon</a></li>
	</ul>

	<hr>

	<h3 id="productImages"><strong>E) Uploading Product Images</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

	<p>For example you're going to upload images for your existing "sample-product.md" file, create a folder with a name <b>"sample-product"</b> <i>(the same name as your product filename)</i> under the "products/" folder where your product file is located:</p>

	<pre>	..
	├── products/sample-product/	&lt;─ The location of your product images.
	├── products/sample-product.md	&lt;─ Your product file.</pre>

	<p>Inside of the "products/sample-product/" folder, you can upload GIF images and rename them numerically, in the following structure:</p>

	<pre>	../..
	├── products/sample-product/1.gif
	├── products/sample-product/2.gif
	├── products/sample-product/3.gif
	├──		&lt;─ etc...</pre>

	<p>Rename them from 1 to the next greater number than it the previous one, increment by increment, and don't miss any next number!<br>
		If you will just upload a single GIF image, then just rename it to "1.gif".</p>

	<b>Here are some sample products with images:</b>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://5ervant.github.io/templates/jekyllshop/demo/products/nikon-d5300/">https://5ervant.github.io/templates/jekyllshop/demo/products/nikon-d5300/</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://5ervant.github.io/templates/jekyllshop/demo/products/sony-nex-6/">https://5ervant.github.io/templates/jekyllshop/demo/products/sony-nex-6/</a></li>
	</ul>

	<hr>

	<h3 id="authorDetails"><strong>F) Specifying Author Details</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

	<p>For example, the <var>author</var> variable of your post or product's YAML front matter, is set to "YourUsername", you can then add more details for that specific author inside of the "_data/people.yml" file, in such like this YAML format:</p>

	<pre>	YourUsername:				# Your author value
	    name: Your Name			# Your real name
	    url: http://www.example.com/	# Your web page address</pre>

	<p>Those details, your real name with a link to your web page will appear on the meta section of your blog posts and your product items.</p>

	<p>For more info, you can visit: <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/#example-accessing-a-specific-author">jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/#example-accessing-a-specific-author</a></p>

	<b>Here are some sample post and products with specified author details:</b>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://5ervant.github.io/templates/jekyllshop/demo/blog/2015/12/03/sample-blog-post/">https://5ervant.github.io/templates/jekyllshop/demo/blog/2015/12/03/sample-blog-post/</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://5ervant.github.io/templates/jekyllshop/demo/products/nikon-d5300/">https://5ervant.github.io/templates/jekyllshop/demo/products/nikon-d5300/</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://5ervant.github.io/templates/jekyllshop/demo/products/sony-nex-6/">https://5ervant.github.io/templates/jekyllshop/demo/products/sony-nex-6/</a></li>
	</ul>

	<hr>

	<h3 id="configuration"><strong>G) Jekyllshop Configuration</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

	<p>In the Jekyllshop directory, there you can see a "_config.yml" file. In that file you can configure your Jekyllshop, just visit that configuration file and set the right settings and payment providers for your online shop.</p>

	<h3>For Examples</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>You need to disable the BACS a.k.a. direct bank transfer method, then change the <var>bacs_enabled</var> setting to 0:
			<pre>	bacs_enabled:        0</pre></li>
		<li>To change your currency, e.g. to Philippine peso, then change the <var>currency_code</var> and the <var>currency_symbol</var> like these:
			<pre>	currency_code:   PHP
	currency_symbol: ₱</pre></li>
		<li>To configure your PayPal email, set the <var>paypal_email</var> setting to your PayPal email address:
			<pre>	paypal_email:       your-paypal-email@example.com</pre></li>
		<li>To disable an "Add to Cart" button or the shopping cart system, change the <var>no_cart_button</var> setting to 1:
			<pre>	no_cart_button:  1</pre></li>
	</ul>

	<p>And there's a lot more that you can do, just visit the "_config.yml" file and change the settings according to what you want, they are well-commented and easy to understand.</p>

	<p>You can either leave an optional setting blank (without anything even quotes) if you want to exclude it..<br>
		<i>"How would I know if it's an optional setting or not?"</i> <u>Simply, if you set it to blank and the site couldn't build, means, that setting is required.</u></p>

	<h3 id="pageDescriptions"><strong>H) Jekyllshop Page Descriptions</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

	<p>You can change the meta descriptions of the Jekyllshop's predefined pages by accessing their Markdown files and editing their contents.</p>

	<p>Here are some of the list of the Jekyllshop's predefined pages that you can edit their descriptions:</p>

	<pre>	.
	├── cart.md
	├── checkout.md
	├── order-details.md	&lt;─ The landing page upon ordering with Bank Transfer or Cash on Delivery method.
	├── payment-made.md	&lt;─ The landing page when online payment is made.
	├── shop.md</pre>

	<p>For example, you're going to edit the Shop page's description, simply edit the content of the "shop.md" file.</p>

	<p>Here is a sample Shop page: <a href="https://5ervant.github.io/templates/jekyllshop/demo/shop/">https://5ervant.github.io/templates/jekyllshop/demo/shop/</a></p>

	<hr>

	<h3 id="creatingPages"><strong>I) Creating Pages</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

	<p>To create a page, simply create a Markdown file, e.g. "sample-page.md", under the Jekyllshop theme's directory, in this format:</p>

	<pre>	---
	layout: page			# Do not change this
	title: Sample Page
	<b>permalink: /sample-page/</b>	# Will be its URL's last directory name
	<b>glyphicon: glyphicon-asterisk</b>	# Will be its page link's icon
	---
	
	Write an awesome Markdown text for your new page here.</pre>

	<p>Your page will now be accessible, e.g. at <em>http://www.yourdomain.com/yourbaseurl<b>/sample-page/</b></em> with its web address' last directory name as the assigned value <b>"/sample-page/"</b> to its YAML front matter's <var>permalink</var> variable.</p>

	<h3>Page Link's Glyphicon</h3>

	<p>To find a right Glyphicon for your page, simply go to <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/#glyphicons-glyphs">getbootstrap.com/components/#glyphicons-glyphs</a> and choose the glyph that you want.</p>

	<p>For example, you chose the <em>"glyphicon <b>glyphicon-plus</b>"</em> icon, copy its succeeded text <b>"glyphicon-plus"</b> and put it as the value of the <var>glyphicon</var> variable of your page's YAML front matter, such like this:</p>

	<pre>	glyphicon: glyphicon-plus</pre>

	<p>After doing that, your page link that's listed on your site navigation will now have a "glyphicon-plus" icon.</p>

	<h3>Unlist and Nofollow a Page</h3>

	<p>If you don't want to list your page on your site navigation, just put the line "<code>robots: nofollow</code>" on its YAML front matter.</p>

	<pre>	---
	layout: page
	title: Sample Page
	permalink: /sample-page/
	<b>robots: nofollow</b>
	---
	
	Write an awesome Markdown text for your new page here.</pre>

	<p>Your page link will now be unlisted on your site navigation. And also, search engines will not list that page in their search results.</p>

	<hr>

	<h3 id="uploadingLogo"><strong>J) Uploading Logo, Header and Favicon</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

	<p>To <u>upload a logo</u> for your site, simply just upload it to the root directory of your Jekyllshop site and rename it as exactly as <b>"logo.gif"</b>.</p>

	<p>To <u>upload a "favicon.ico"</u>, just also upload it to the root directory. It needs a basename as exactly as <b>"favicon.ico"</b>.</p>

	<p>You can also delete the "logo.gif" and the "favicon.ico" if you want. If the "logo.gif" is missing, your site's title will be shown in the logo area.</p>

	<p>To <u>upload a header image</u>, upload a "header"-named GIF image into your root directory. It needs a basename as exactly as <b>"header.gif"</b>.</p>

	<hr>

	<h3 id="installingComments"><strong>K) Installing a Comments Plugin</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

	<p>There are plenty of blog comments' plugins out there that can use, for your blog posts to be able your readers to post a comment.<p>

	<h3>And these are some of them:</h3>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://disqus.com/admin/signup/">Disqus Comments plugin</a> (Drive Engagement)</li>
		<li><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/comments">Facebook Comments plugin</a> (Social Plugins)</li>

	<p>For example, you're going to use Disqus Comments plugin, after configuring your Comments plugin, you can then open the "_includes/plugins/post-comments.html" file and paste the whole Universal Code to be able your comments to load, into that file!</p>

	<hr>

	<h3 id="widgetsPlugins"><strong>L) Widgets and Plugins</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

	<p>You do not need to worry about some other Jekyllshop's predefined widgets and plugins because:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Once you've created some products, they will be automatically listed in the <b>Products Vertical</b> and <b>Products Horizontal</b> widgets that are pre-installed on your Jekyllshop.</li>
		<li>And once your products have their own images, their images will be shown in the <b>Intro-Carousel</b> plugin, the <b>Products Vertical</b> widget and in the <b>Products Horizontal</b> widget.</li>
		<li>The <b>Search</b> (Engine) widget can start to find a result with or without an image, once you've a created product. And a lot more!</li>
	</ul>

	<hr>

	<h3 id="credits"><strong>M) Sources and Credits</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

	<p>I've used the following frameworks, images, icons or other files as listed.</p>
