I'll use Visual Studio Community to develop Windows applications using one of the following mentioned libraries that are parts of Microsoft .NET Framework, as listed:

 - Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)
 - Windows Forms (WinForms)

And will use "Microsoft Blend for Visual Studio", for designing some Windows desktop user interface' elements that are based on Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML), and will going to use WiX Toolset for creating installers or setup programs if still possible and necessary.
