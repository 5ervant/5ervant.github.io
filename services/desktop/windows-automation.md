I'll use AutoIt v3 to create a macro or a script for automating your routine and repetitive tasks and that includes the following:

 - Internet Explorer browser automation
 - FireFox browser automation (Required you to install the add-on [MozRepl](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mozrepl/){:target="_blank"}.)
 - Facebook automation using their Graph API and cURL for transferring data.
 - Microsoft Word automation
 - Or any other Windows desktop automation with keystroke and mouse simulations.
